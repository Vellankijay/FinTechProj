# 🧠 RiskPulse - Real-Time Risk Intelligence for Electronic Trading

## 🎯 Goal / Purpose
To build **RiskPulse**, a **real-time risk intelligence platform** that continuously tracks, detects, and mitigates financial and operational risks during live electronic trading — designed for both **buy-side (portfolio managers)** and **sell-side (trading desks)** users.

---

## ⚙️ Core Idea
A **live monitoring engine** that ingests market and trade data, computes risk metrics on the fly, and triggers **alerts or automated responses** when thresholds or anomalies are detected.

---

## 🧩 Key System Components

### 🔹 Data Feeds
- Real-time market data, order books, and executed trade information.

### 🔹 Risk Engine
- Calculates risk metrics in real time (e.g., **VaR**, **stress tests**, **exposures**, **liquidity risk**).

### 🔹 Alert System
- Triggers notifications or “kill switches” when thresholds are breached (e.g., large drawdowns or abnormal trading).

### 🔹 Integration Layer
- Connects to **EMS/OMS systems** for immediate trading actions (halt trades, rebalance portfolio).

## 📊 Typical Risk Metrics
- **Value-at-Risk (VaR)**  
- **Intraday P&L and exposure**  
- **Position concentration limits**  
- **Order flow anomalies and market impact detection**

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack / Techniques
- **Complex Event Processing (CEP):** correlate real-time events  
- **Machine Learning:** detect anomalies and predict risk  
- **Distributed Systems / Cloud:** handle large-scale streaming data  
- **Low-Latency Engineering:** ensure millisecond-level decisions

---

## 💡 Example Use Cases
- Stop a **runaway trading algorithm**  
- Trigger alerts when **portfolio loss exceeds a threshold**  
- **Auto-rebalance** portfolio exposures  
- Flag **unusual liquidity** or **market impact patterns**

---

## ⚖️ Challenges
- Maintaining **ultra-low latency**  
- Avoiding **false positives**  
- Integrating with **legacy systems**  
- Managing **model drift** and validation (for ML-based detection)

---

## 🚀 Future Direction
- **Adaptive AI-driven** risk models  
- **Cross-asset, multi-market** risk visualization  
- **Predictive analytics** for pre-trade risk control
